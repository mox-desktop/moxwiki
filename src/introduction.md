# Mox

## About

Welcome to **Mox**, a modern Wayland desktop environment built from the ground up in memory‑safe Rust. Mox strips away heavyweight GUI libraries and instead drives your hardware directly—so every pixel and frame is fully accelerated.

Key features:

- **Zero GUI frameworks**\
  Mox relies directly on Wayland, Vulkan, and WGPU keeping the entire stack small, auditable, and lightning‑fast.

- **Fully hardware-accelerated**\
  Different components use either Vulkan or WGPU, depending on their needs, for optimal performance.

- **Memory-safe core**\
  Written entirely in Rust, Mox ensures safety without sacrificing speed.

- **Keyboard-first design**\
  The entire environment is operable using only the keyboard, making it fast, efficient, and accessible.
